# Matplotlib basic example

Generates a pie chart using the Matplotlib library in Python. It defines a function called generate_pie_chart() which creates a simple pie chart with predefined labels ('A', 'B', 'C') and corresponding values (200, 34, 120). The pie chart is then saved as an image file named 'pie.png' using the savefig() function, and the plot is closed using the close() function. This code snippet demonstrates a basic usage of Matplotlib to visualize data in the form of a pie chart.

## What i leraned

-   **Data Visualization**: Understanding how to create visual representations of data, such as pie charts, using Matplotlib library in Python.

-   **Matplotlib Basics**: Learning the basics of Matplotlib, including how to create plots, customize plot elements, and save plots as image files.

-   **Pie Charts**: Understanding the concept of pie charts as a way to represent proportions or percentages of a whole.

-   **Labels and Values**: Learning how to specify labels and corresponding values for a pie chart using Matplotlib.

-   **Subplots**: Understanding how to create subplots in Matplotlib to allow for more complex figure layouts.

-   **File Saving**: Learning how to save plots generated with Matplotlib as image files, such as PNG or JPEG.

-   **Plot Customization**: Exploring options for customizing the appearance of plots, including colors, labels, legends, and more.

-   **Plot Closing**: Understanding the importance of closing plots after they have been generated to free up system resources and avoid memory leaks.

## Usage

We can run this basic example by executing the main.py file located in `matplotlib-charts/main.py`.

```sh
# clone de repo
git clone https://github.com/cristianorregodev/learning-python.git

#open the project
cd learning-python

#run rps-game
python3 matplotlib-charts/main.py

```

Then you only to visualize the output file generated --> `pie.png`
